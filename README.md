# 🚀 Python OOP Project – Smartphone & Polymorphism
This repository contains two mini Python projects demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like classes, inheritance, constructors, and polymorphism.

# 📁 Contents
1. Smartphone Class
A custom class to represent a smartphone with attributes and methods:

Attributes: brand, model, battery_life

# Methods:

show_details() – Displays the phone's information.

charge_phone() – Fully charges the phone battery.

2. Polymorphism Challenge
A set of vehicle classes that share the same method move(), but perform it differently:

Car.move() → Prints: "Driving 🚗"

Plane.move() → Prints: "Flying ✈️"

This demonstrates polymorphism – same method name, different behavior.

# 🧠 Learning Objectives
Understand how to define and use classes and objects.

Explore class constructors (__init__) for initialization.

Practice method overloading through polymorphism.

Apply inheritance to build clean and reusable code.

# 🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.x

A code editor (like VS Code, PyCharm, or any text editor)
